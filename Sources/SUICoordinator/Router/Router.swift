/// A class representing a router in the coordinator pattern.
///
/// `Router` is responsible for the actual navigation and presentation of views or coordinators
/// within a coordinator-based architecture. It manages navigation stacks, modal presentations,
/// and provides a unified interface for all navigation operations.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - **Navigation Stack Management**: Handles push/pop operations in navigation stacks
/// - **Modal Presentation**: Manages sheets, full-screen covers, and custom presentations
/// - **Animation Control**: Configurable animation for all navigation operations
/// - **Thread Safety**: Uses actors internally for safe concurrent access
/// - **Flexible Presentation**: Supports multiple presentation styles and transitions
///
/// ## Navigation Types
/// - **Push Navigation**: Added to navigation stack for hierarchical navigation
/// - **Modal Presentation**: Presented as sheets or full-screen covers
/// - **Custom Transitions**: Support for custom presentation animations
///
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```swift
/// let router = Router<AppRoute>()
///
/// // Navigate with push (adds to navigation stack)
/// await router.navigate(toRoute: .profile(user), presentationStyle: .push)
///
/// // Present modally
/// await router.present(.settings, presentationStyle: .sheet)
///
/// // Pop back
/// await router.pop(animated: true)
/// ```
