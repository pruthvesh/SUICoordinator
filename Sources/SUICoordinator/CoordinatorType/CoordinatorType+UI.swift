import SwiftUI

/// Extension providing UI-related functionality for coordinator types.
///
/// This extension bridges the gap between coordinators and SwiftUI by providing
/// methods to convert coordinators into SwiftUI views that can be integrated
/// into the view hierarchy.
public extension CoordinatorType {
    
    /// Creates and returns a SwiftUI view representation of the coordinator.
    ///
    /// This method wraps the coordinator in a `CoordinatorView`, which handles
    /// the integration between the coordinator's navigation logic and SwiftUI's
    /// view system.
    ///
    /// The returned view automatically manages:
    /// - Navigation stack presentation
    /// - Modal sheet presentations
    /// - Router state synchronization
    /// - Proper lifecycle management
    ///
    /// - Returns: A SwiftUI view that represents this coordinator's interface.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// struct ContentView: View {
    ///     @StateObject var mainCoordinator = MainCoordinator()
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         mainCoordinator.getView()
    ///             .onAppear {
    ///                 Task {
    ///                     await mainCoordinator.start()
    ///                 }
    ///             }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Integration Notes
    /// - The view automatically handles router state changes
    /// - Navigation operations are properly reflected in the UI
    /// - Modal presentations are managed transparently
    /// - The coordinator remains the source of truth for navigation state
    @ViewBuilder
    func getView() -> some View {
        CoordinatorView(dataSource: self)
    }
}
