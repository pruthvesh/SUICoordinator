    /// Retrieves the top coordinator in the hierarchy, optionally starting from a specified coordinator.
    ///
    /// This method traverses the coordinator hierarchy to find the deepest active coordinator,
    /// which is typically the one currently handling user interactions. It's useful for
    /// determining where new navigation operations should be performed.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - pCoodinator: The optional starting point for finding the top coordinator.
    ///                  If `nil`, starts from the last child of the current coordinator.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The top coordinator in the hierarchy, or `nil` if none is found.
    /// - Throws: An error if the top coordinator retrieval fails due to hierarchy issues.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// if let topCoordinator = try coordinator.topCoordinator() {
    ///     await topCoordinator.navigate(to: newCoordinator, presentationStyle: .sheet)
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// Navigates to a new coordinator with a specified presentation style.
    ///
    /// This method handles coordinator-to-coordinator navigation by setting up the child relationship,
    /// creating the appropriate sheet item, and managing the presentation lifecycle.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - coordinator: The coordinator to navigate to. This coordinator will become a child
    ///                  of the current coordinator.
    ///   - presentationStyle: The transition presentation style for the navigation.
    ///                        Determines how the new coordinator's view will be presented.
    ///   - animated: A boolean value indicating whether to animate the navigation. Defaults to `true`.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// let profileCoordinator = ProfileCoordinator()
    /// await currentCoordinator.navigate(
    ///     to: profileCoordinator,
    ///     presentationStyle: .sheet,
    ///     animated: true
    /// )
    /// ```

    ///
    /// This method cleanly terminates the coordinator's flow by performing cleanup operations
    /// and removing the coordinator from the hierarchy. It handles both dismissal and cleanup.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - animated: A boolean value indicating whether to animate the finish flow process.
    ///               Defaults to `true`.
    ///
    /// ## Usage Notes
    /// - Call this method when a coordinator's purpose has been fulfilled
    /// - The coordinator will be removed from its parent's children array
    /// - Any presented views or sheets will be dismissed
    /// - Resources will be cleaned up automatically

    /// This method initializes the coordinator's main view with the provided route,
    /// establishing the foundation for the coordinator's navigation flow.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - route: The route to start the flow with. This becomes the coordinator's main view.
    ///   - transitionStyle: The transition presentation style for the flow. Currently unused
    ///                      but reserved for future functionality.
    ///   - animated: A boolean value indicating whether to animate the start flow process.
    ///               Defaults to `true`.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// await coordinator.startFlow(
    ///     route: HomeRoute.main,
    ///     transitionStyle: .push,
    ///     animated: true
    /// )
    /// ```

    ///
    /// This method provides a way to present a coordinator from anywhere in the hierarchy
    /// by finding the top coordinator and using it to present this coordinator.
    /// It's useful for global navigation operations or deep linking scenarios.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - animated: A boolean value indicating whether to animate the presentation.
    ///               Defaults to `true`.
    ///   - presentationStyle: The transition presentation style for the forced presentation.
    ///                        Defaults to `.sheet`.
    ///   - mainCoordinator: The main coordinator from which to find the top coordinator.
    ///                      If `nil`, the operation may fail if no proper hierarchy exists.
    ///
    /// - Throws: An error if the presentation cannot be forced due to hierarchy issues
    ///           or if the top coordinator cannot be determined.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// ```swift
    /// try await emergencyCoordinator.forcePresentation(
    ///     animated: true,
    ///     presentationStyle: .fullScreenCover,
    ///     mainCoordinator: appCoordinator
    /// )
    /// ```

    ///
    /// This method provides a way to reset the coordinator's navigation state,
    /// clearing all navigation stacks and modal presentations.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - animated: A boolean value indicating whether to animate the restart action.
    ///               Defaults to `true`.
    ///
    /// ## Usage Notes
    /// - All navigation history will be lost
    /// - Modal presentations will be dismissed
    /// - The coordinator will return to its initial state
    /// - Useful for logout scenarios or major state changes
    func restart(animated: Bool = true) async {
